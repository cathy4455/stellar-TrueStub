/**
 * RefundService — issue #153
 *
 * Enforces idempotency on refund claims:
 *   - First claim for a given refundId → records the claim and returns the
 *     refund details.
 *   - Subsequent claims for the same refundId → throws RefundAlreadyClaimed.
 *
 * Storage is an in-process Map by default (sufficient for a single-node
 * deployment).  Production deployments that run multiple replicas should
 * swap the store implementation for a shared Redis/DB store; the
 * RefundStore interface below makes that substitution straightforward.
 *
 * Cleanup / TTL
 * -------------
 * Claimed records are retained in memory until `cleanupBefore(cutoff)` is
 * called (e.g. on a scheduled job or when the process runs out of memory).
 * For persistent deployments, a DB-backed store provides its own retention
 * policy.  See the README section "Storage cleanup" for recommended schedules.
 *
 * On-chain execution (#252)
 * -------------------------
 * When constructed with a `RefundExecutor`, a successful claim also moves the
 * funds: the shared singleton uses `TrustlessWorkRefundExecutor`, which
 * resolves the escrow's dispute via Trustless Work with 100% of `amount`
 * distributed to `refundTo`, signs as the platform dispute resolver, and
 * submits the transaction to Stellar.  Preconditions (enforced on-chain):
 *   - `escrowId` is the Trustless Work escrow contract id (C...).
 *   - The escrow is already in dispute (buyer opened it via startDispute).
 *   - `amount` equals the escrow's full disputed balance.
 * The contract rejects resolving an already-resolved escrow, so funds cannot
 * move twice even if two replicas race past the in-memory idempotency check.
